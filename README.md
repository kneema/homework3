# homework3
Homework 3 requires us to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The screenshot shows the example case of the homework 3.
In my case, I decided to do a form on the page instead of prompts to make it a better user experience.
